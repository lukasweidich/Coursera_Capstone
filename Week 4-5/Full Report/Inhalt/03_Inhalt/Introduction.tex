\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation}
As a customer, I am always overwhelmed by all the buying options I am confronted with on a daily basis. Especially when looking for computers and hardware, there are seemingly endless stores and possibilities just around the corner. While these stores are professional businesses, I wonder whether private offerings are also that strongly represented within my local area. To find out, I will make use of business data provided by Foursquare and compare it to currently active eBay listings near me. By also visualizing the data, I hope to underline my findings even more.
\section{Who will profit from the insights}
Both, buyers and sellers, can profit from the results portrayed in this short report. Buyers can use the data to further understand the available options to choose from when buying computers or hardware. Sellers can increase their competitive advantages by getting to know their surroundings, such as other stores or active listings nearby. Also, anyone interested in the vast field of data science is able to get an impression of what to expect from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

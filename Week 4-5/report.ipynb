For this, I will use the eBay API and Foursquare API to find out whether there are especially popular areas for offering computer services and hardware. Also, I am interested in whether the Foursquare business locations are in any other way related to the current eBay listings regarding location. Using this information, I am going to identify and visualize less popular areas and might be able to find less competitive locations to set up a new business."

By using the eBay API, i will be able to access all current listings within my area for a certain query. Combining these two, I hope to get insights into certain hotspots that are accumulating most of the total offerings. The eBay data will be available locally within this project while the Foursquare data will be fetched within the notebook."
